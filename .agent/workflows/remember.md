description: Store a fact or preference in the long-term project memory
---

1. Read the current memory file at `.agent/memory.md`. If it doesn't exist, I will create it.
2. Append the new information provided by the user to the appropriate section (Architecture, Preferences, Goals, or History).
3. Summarize what was saved to confirm I've "remembered" it.
4. Use this memory file as context for all future tasks.
