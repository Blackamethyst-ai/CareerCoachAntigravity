description: Deploy a sub-agent to perform deep research on a technical topic or competitor.
---

1. Launch a `browser_subagent` with the specific research goal.
2. The sub-agent must visit at least 3 distinct sources (documentation, blogs, or github repos).
3. The sub-agent must extract code snippets, configuration examples, or architectural patterns.
4. Once the sub-agent returns, I will summarize the findings and offer to create a new library or component based on the research.
5. Save the final research report to `.agent/research/[topic].md`.
