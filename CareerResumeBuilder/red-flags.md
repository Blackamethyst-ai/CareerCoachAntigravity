# Red Flags: Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Common mistakes that get resumes rejected.

## Resume Red Flags

### Content Issues

❌ **Vague responsibilities without outcomes**
> "Responsible for managing client relationships"

✅ **Fix:** Add metrics and results
> "Managed portfolio of 50+ enterprise clients, achieving 95% retention rate"

---

❌ **Unexplained employment gaps**
> [6+ month gaps with no context]

✅ **Fix:** Address proactively
> Brief explanation in cover letter; list relevant activities during gap

---

❌ **Job hopping without context**
> [Multiple <1 year stints without explanation]

✅ **Fix:** Address pattern
> Note contract roles, acquisitions, or strategic moves; consolidate similar roles

---

❌ **Overqualification signals**
> VP applying for Manager role without acknowledgment

✅ **Fix:** Right-size presentation
> Acknowledge transition in summary; focus on relevant scope, not max scope

---

❌ **Generic objectives**
> "Seeking a challenging position where I can leverage my skills"

✅ **Fix:** Role-specific summary
> "[Your title] with X years in [relevant domain], proven track record of [key achievement]"

---

❌ **Outdated or irrelevant experience**
> Leading with 15-year-old entry-level role

✅ **Fix:** Prioritize recent relevance
> Compress or remove old irrelevant roles; lead with most relevant regardless of recency

---

❌ **Inconsistent formatting**
> Mixed date formats, inconsistent bullet styles, random bolding

✅ **Fix:** Systematic consistency
> One date format, one bullet style, logical emphasis hierarchy

---

❌ **Typos and grammatical errors**
> "Manger" "Responisble" "Their/There" errors

✅ **Fix:** Multiple review passes
> Proofread, use tools, have another person review

---

❌ **Personal information overshare**
> Age, marital status, photo, hobbies unrelated to role

✅ **Fix:** Professional relevance only
> Include only what supports candidacy; hobbies only if directly relevant

---

❌ **Buzzword overload**
> "Synergistic thought leader leveraging paradigm shifts"

✅ **Fix:** Concrete specifics
> Replace buzzwords with evidence and metrics

### Structural Issues

❌ **Dense text blocks**
> Paragraphs instead of scannable bullets

✅ **Fix:** Visual hierarchy
> Use bullets, white space, clear sections

---

❌ **Missing contact information**
> No email, phone, or location

✅ **Fix:** Complete header
> Email, phone, LinkedIn, city/state (no full address needed)

---

❌ **Unprofessional email**
> partyguy420@hotmail.com

✅ **Fix:** Professional address
> firstname.lastname@gmail.com or professional domain

---

❌ **Broken links**
> LinkedIn URL that doesn't work, GitHub with no content

✅ **Fix:** Verify all links
> Test before submission; only include valuable destinations

---

❌ **Wrong file format**
> Image-based PDF, .pages file, Google Doc link

✅ **Fix:** Standard formats
> .docx or text-based PDF only

## Cover Letter Red Flags

❌ **"To Whom It May Concern"**
✅ Research the hiring manager or use "Dear [Company] Team"

❌ **Rehashing resume bullets**
✅ Tell a compelling narrative that adds context

❌ **Generic template obvious**
✅ Customize opening and company-specific paragraph

❌ **Focusing on what YOU want**
✅ Focus on what you OFFER the employer

❌ **Negative language**
> "I lack experience in..." "I'm not sure if..."
✅ Confident, positive framing of transferable skills

❌ **Excessive length**
> More than 1 page, dense paragraphs
✅ 3-4 concise paragraphs, under 400 words

❌ **Salary expectations unprompted**
✅ Only discuss if explicitly requested

❌ **Desperation signals**
> "I really need this job" "I'll take anything"
✅ Confident professional positioning

## Interview Prep Red Flags

❌ **No research on company**
✅ Know mission, recent news, products, culture

❌ **Badmouthing previous employers**
✅ Diplomatic explanations, focus on growth

❌ **No questions for interviewer**
✅ Prepare 3-5 thoughtful questions

❌ **Can't elaborate on resume bullets**
✅ Prepare STAR stories for every achievement

❌ **Inconsistencies with resume**

## Integrity Red Flags
