# AI Fluency Criteria: The 4Ds Framework

Evaluation criteria for AI-assisted resume tailoring based on Anthropic's AI Fluency framework.

## Overview

AI Fluency is the ability to work with AI systems in ways that are **effective, efficient, ethical, and safe**. This skill operationalizes the 4Ds for resume tailoring.

## The 4Ds Applied

### 1. Delegation

**Definition:** Deciding what work should be done by humans vs. AI.

#### Human Responsibilities
- Provide accurate Master Profile content
- Make final accuracy verification
- Decide whether to apply
- Handle actual submission
- Interview and follow-up
- Career strategy decisions

#### AI Responsibilities
- Parse and structure profile data
- Analyze job descriptions
- Calculate match scores
- Generate tailored content
- Identify gaps and recommendations
- Format for ATS compatibility
- Track applications

#### Quality Criteria
| Criterion | Measure |
|-----------|---------|
| Clear task boundaries | Human/AI split documented |
| Appropriate automation | Repetitive tasks automated |
| Human oversight | All outputs require review |
| Escalation paths | Gaps flagged for human decision |

### 2. Description

**Definition:** Effectively communicating with AI systems.

#### Product Description (Output Specs)
- **Resume:** .docx, ATS-formatted, targeted length
- **Match Report:** Markdown, scored breakdown, actionable gaps
- **Cover Letter:** Professional tone, 3-4 paragraphs, company-specific
- **Interview Prep:** STAR-formatted talking points
- **Negotiation Brief:** Leverage analysis with specific recommendations

#### Process Description (How AI Works)
1. Parse inputs into structured sections
2. Extract job requirements with classification
3. Score alignment across 6 dimensions
4. Generate content with keyword mirroring
5. Apply anti-hallucination checks
6. Format for target audience (ATS + human)

#### Performance Description (Behavior Guidelines)
- **Tone:** Professional, confident, accurate
- **Specificity:** Concrete over vague
- **Honesty:** Flag gaps rather than fill them
- **Relevance:** Only include supporting content

### 3. Discernment

**Definition:** Critically evaluating AI outputs.

#### Product Discernment (Output Quality)
| Check | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| Accuracy | All claims traceable to Master Profile |
| Relevance | Content serves target role |
| Coherence | Narrative flows logically |
| Completeness | No critical gaps unaddressed |
| Format | ATS-safe, professionally presented |

#### Process Discernment (Method Quality)
| Check | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| Scoring validity | Rubric applied consistently |
| Keyword extraction | Job requirements captured |
| Match classification | Direct/transferable/gap accurate |
| Prioritization | Most relevant content emphasized |

#### Performance Discernment (Behavior Quality)
| Check | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| No hallucination | Zero fabricated content |
| Appropriate confidence | Gaps acknowledged |
| User alignment | Preferences respected |
| Consistency | Same inputs = same outputs |

### 4. Diligence

**Definition:** Using AI responsibly and ethically.

#### Creation Diligence (Thoughtful Use)
- Skill designed for legitimate job seeking
- User controls all inputs
- No deceptive automation (auto-apply spam)
- Privacy-respecting (user data stays local)

#### Transparency Diligence (Honest Disclosure)
- AI Fluency footer on all outputs
- Users informed of AI involvement
- Match scores include methodology
- Gaps explicitly called out

#### Deployment Diligence (Output Accountability)
- Human review required before submission
- User vouches for final content
- No submission without verification
- Application logging for tracking
