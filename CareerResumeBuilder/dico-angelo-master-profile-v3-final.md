## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY ARCHETYPES

*Select the narrative that best aligns with the target role.*

### Archetype A: The Architect-Operator Hybrid (Default)
*Use for: Most technical roles, program management*

> Builder-first GTM Systems & Agentic Automation leader who transforms ambiguous partner motion into clean, scalable operating systems. I operate at the intersection where strategic partnerships, technical execution, and systems architecture converge. As an architect-operator hybrid, I unite the blueprint of an architect with hands-on execution—building the tooling, integrations, and automations that power high-functioning partner ecosystems. I became the person who made the system tell the truth—and then made it run faster.

### Archetype B: The Systems Convergence Specialist
*Use for: Cloud alliances, hyperscaler partnerships, enterprise operations*

> Partner Operations & Systems Leader with deep partner-ecosystem fluency. I sit at the intersection of GTM partnerships, program operations, and data integrity. My edge is systems convergence—combining technical fluency with an instinct for workflows that compound over time. In partner-room settings, I'm known as the high-signal operator who connects strategy ('what we're trying to win') to mechanics (deal reg, incentives, MDF/credits, governance). I manage the operational backbone of high-stakes alliances, ensuring system integrity determines whether partner GTM scales or collapses under volume.

### Archetype C: The Frontier AI Builder
*Use for: Anthropic, OpenAI, AI-native companies, DevRel*

> AI Founder and Systems Architect actively building in the trenches of the generative landscape. I got tired of humans being the execution layer for repetitive GTM work—so I started building the agentic systems to replace that friction. Creator of "Structura" (a Sovereign OS) and the "Agentic Partner Weaver" framework. I bridge research and deployment, going from new model capability to functional GTM application in days. Core belief: dashboards don't win deals; correct reality delivered at speed does.

### Archetype D: Technical Program Manager
*Use for: Google DeepMind, NVIDIA, structured PM roles*

> Technical operator bridging AI systems, infrastructure, and cross-functional teams. Proven at enterprise scale managing $800M+ in cloud partnerships across AWS and Microsoft ecosystems, contributing to 2x Microsoft Partner of the Year wins. Now architecting agentic systems from first principles. Career arc: Process Mastery → Product & People Operations → Global Partner Ecosystems → AI Systems Architecture. Research-driven builder who ships.

## NARRATIVE BLOCKS FOR COVER LETTERS

### The Builder Identity
> "I got tired of humans being the execution layer for repetitive GTM work—so I started building the agentic systems to replace that friction. I'm not content to simply manage existing processes; I'm driven to architect the next generation of operational infrastructure."

### On Systems Convergence
> "My edge is systems convergence—combining technical fluency with an instinct for workflows that compound over time. I translate ambiguity into workflows, tooling, and reporting that teams can trust. In partner-room settings, I'm the high-signal operator who connects strategy ('what we're trying to win') to mechanics (deal reg, incentives, MDF/credits, governance)."

### On Making Systems Tell the Truth
> "I became the person who made the system tell the truth—and then made it run faster. That foundation is why I'm valuable in operations roles: I know how enterprise GTM breaks at scale, and I know how to rebuild it so it doesn't."

### The Core Insight
> "Dashboards don't win deals; correct reality delivered at speed does. I implement context architectures that render system data at the right altitude—operator mode vs. exec mode—because different stakeholders need different views of the same truth."

### On AI Safety & Operations (Anthropic-specific)
> "I'm drawn to Anthropic because you've made deployment discipline the product. When Claude is distributed through major enterprise channels, the difference between 'trusted platform' and 'risky vendor' shows up in the operational layer—audit trails, clean entitlements, repeatable eval workflows. I want to help build the partner operating system that makes reliability measurable and deployable at scale."

### Career Arc Summary
> "My career follows a deliberate progression: mastering process mechanics at Edison, scaling product and people operations at Rocket Mortgage, owning global partner ecosystems at Contentsquare, and now architecting AI-native systems at Metaventions. Each phase built on the last—from mechanics to architecture."

## POSITIONING NOTES

### The Compound Story
**Enterprise Scale** (Contentsquare: $800M, 2x MSFT POY) + **Technical Depth** (Metaventions: AI-native systems) + **Unique Background** (SpaceX Hyperloop finalist). This combination is rare.

### Under-titled at Contentsquare
Always reframe as actual scope: Cloud Alliance Manager + Partner Programs Lead. The "Cloud Operations Specialist" title undersells the work.

### Metaventions Framing
Not about the company—about capabilities built and problems solved. Proof of hands-on AI/technical proficiency and first-principles thinking.

### SpaceX Angle
For SpaceX/aerospace applications: Lead with Hyperloop competition finals and Elon introduction. Shows prior orbit.

### Education Accuracy
**CRITICAL:** Honours BBA (undergraduate), NOT MBA. Verify correct on ALL materials before submission.

### Anti-Sales Positioning
Emphasize: builder, systems, architect, operations, programs, strategic partnerships, research.
Avoid: quota, closing, AE, commission, sales targets.
